### **Phase 12 — Performance** ✅ COMPLETE
**Goals:**

- ✅ useEncounter functions wrapped in useCallback with proper dependencies
- ✅ Subscription optimization: only refetch on actual data changes

**Performance Improvements:**
- Initiative tracker efficiently handles 100+ combatants

- Reduced unnecessary re-renders via memoization
- Subscriptions filter by encounter_id to avoid global updates
- Encounter updates only trigger on round changes

- Idempotency keys for actions

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created shared rate limiter module for edge functions
- ✅ Implemented idempotency key system for combat actions
- ✅ Added rate limiting to apply-damage function (100 req/min)

- 24-hour idempotency window
- Automatic rate limit headers (Retry-After)
- DM authorization already enforced (existing)
- RLS policies prevent player self-mutation (existing)

**Security Scan Results:**
