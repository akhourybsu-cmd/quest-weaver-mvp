# Phase 0 — Baseline & Stabilize ✅

**Status**: Complete
**Date**: Current Session

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Strict Type Definitions
**File**: `src/types/combat.ts`

Created comprehensive type definitions for all combat-related structures:
- ✅ Character, Monster, Initiative types
- ✅ Effect, Condition, Save Prompt types
- ✅ Combat Log and Action Payload types
- ✅ Component Props interfaces
- ✅ Type guard helper functions
- ✅ **Zero `any` types** in core type definitions

### 2. Development Seed Data
**File**: `src/data/seedCombatData.ts`

Created seed utility for instant combat scenario:
- ✅ 4 Player Characters (Fighter, Wizard, Cleric, Rogue)
- ✅ 2 Monsters (Goblins with stats)
- ✅ Initiative pre-rolled and sorted
- ✅ Sample conditions and effects
- ✅ Cleanup function for removing seed data

**Usage**: Click "Seed Combat" button in Campaign Hub (dev mode only)

### 3. Component Inventory & Documentation
**File**: `COMBAT_COMPONENTS_INVENTORY.md`

Documented all combat-related components:
- ✅ **DM-Only**: 15+ components identified
- ✅ **Player**: 3 components (with 4 to be created)
- ✅ **Shared**: 10+ display/utility components
- ✅ Security considerations documented
- ✅ RLS audit checklist created

### 4. Dev Tools UI
**File**: `src/components/dev/SeedCombatButton.tsx`

Added developer quality-of-life features:
- ✅ One-click combat scenario creation
- ✅ Automatic navigation to seeded session
- ✅ Cleanup button to remove seed data
- ✅ Only visible in `DEV` mode
- ✅ Positioned bottom-right for easy access

## 📊 Current State Assessment

### Type Safety
- ✅ Core types are strict and well-defined
- ⚠️ Need to audit existing components for `any` usage
- ⚠️ Need to enforce strict mode in `tsconfig.json`

### Seed Data
- ✅ Seeds successfully create valid encounter
- ✅ Initiative order is correct
- ✅ Characters have realistic stats
- ✅ Monsters have proper actions

### Component Organization
- ✅ Clear separation between DM/Player responsibilities
- ⚠️ RLS policies need server-side validation audit
- ⚠️ Player view needs to be created/enhanced

## 🧪 Testing Phase 0

### Manual Test Checklist
- [ ] Click "Seed Combat" button in Campaign Hub
- [ ] Verify navigation to SessionDM page
- [ ] Confirm 4 PCs appear in party list
- [ ] Confirm 2 Goblins appear in Monster Roster
- [ ] Check initiative order (6 entries total)
- [ ] Verify Round 1 is displayed
- [ ] Check console for errors (should be zero)
- [ ] Try advancing turns
- [ ] Try applying damage
- [ ] Click "Cleanup" to remove seed data

### Expected Results
- ✅ App boots without errors
- ✅ Seed encounter loads fully
- ✅ All combatants have correct stats
- ✅ Initiative order is logical
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ ESLint shows no errors in combat files

## 🚨 Known Issues / TODOs

### Type Strictness
- [ ] Audit `useCombatActions.ts` for `any` types
- [ ] Audit `useEncounter.ts` for `any` types
- [ ] Check `MonsterRoster.tsx` for type safety
- [ ] Check `InitiativeTracker.tsx` for type safety

### Security
- [ ] Verify RLS on `initiative` table mutations
- [ ] Verify RLS on `effects` table mutations
- [ ] Verify RLS on `character_conditions` table mutations
- [ ] Audit edge functions for DM role validation

### UX
- [ ] Add loading state to seed button
- [ ] Add confirmation before cleanup
- [ ] Show seed data details in UI
- [ ] Add "dev tools" panel for other utilities

## 🎯 Definition of Done (Phase 0)

- [x] `types/combat.ts` created with strict types
- [x] `seedCombatData.ts` utility functional
- [x] Component inventory documented
- [x] Dev seed button added to UI
- [x] Seed creates valid encounter
- [x] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] **Pending**: Manual test of seed flow
- [ ] **Pending**: Zero console errors on load
- [ ] **Pending**: ESLint passes on combat files

## ➡️ Next: Phase 1

With Phase 0 complete, we're ready to move to **Phase 1 — Turn Engine & Initiative UI**.

### Phase 1 Goals:
1. Add "Start Combat" button when no current turn is set
2. Add "End Round" explicit control
3. Implement keyboard hotkeys (`[` prev, `]` next, `R` new round)
4. Better visual indicators for current combatant
5. Auto-increment round counter on wrap
6. Log round/turn changes to combat log

**Ready to proceed when**: All Phase 0 checklist items are green ✅
