- Real-time increment/decrement controls
- Clean UI with badge indicators showing available/total resources
- Automatic sync with character database
- Player-editable when `canEdit={true}`

### 2. **Resource Setup Dialog** (`src/components/combat/ResourceSetupDialog.tsx`)
- Full resource configuration interface for characters
- **Spell Slots:**
  - Add spell slots by level (1-9)
  - Specify total slots per level
  - Remove spell slots
  - Sorted display by level

  - Add custom-named resources (Rage, Ki Points, Sorcery Points, etc.)
  - Set total amount
  - Define reset timing (Short Rest or Long Rest)
  - Remove resources

### 3. **Player Character Sheet Integration**
- `ResourceTracker` now displays on player view during active/paused encounters

### 4. **Campaign Hub Integration**
- Added "Manage Resources" button next to "Rest" in Campaign Hub
- Players can configure their character's spell slots and class resources
- Updates persist and sync across all views

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### For Players:
1. **Setup Resources** (Campaign Hub):
   - Click "Manage Resources" next to the Rest button
   - Add spell slots for each level (e.g., Level 1: 4 slots, Level 2: 3 slots)
   - Add class resources (e.g., Rage: 3 uses, resets on Long Rest)
   - Save configuration

2. **Track During Combat** (Session Player):
   - View all spell slots with visual dot indicators
   - See class resources with reset timing
   - Click +/- to mark spell slots or resources as used
   - Resources update in real-time

3. **Rest to Restore**:
   - Short Rest: Restores resources marked "Short Rest"
   - Long Rest: Restores ALL resources and spell slots

### For DMs:
- Can view player resources on their character sheets
- PartyRestManager automatically restores all resources during party long rests

## ðŸ“¦ Data Structure

Resources are stored in `characters.resources` as JSONB:

```typescript
{
  spellSlots: [
    { level: 1, total: 4, used: 1 },
    { level: 2, total: 3, used: 0 }
  ],
  classResources: [
    { name: "Rage", total: 3, used: 2, resetOn: "long" },
    { name: "Ki Points", total: 4, used: 1, resetOn: "short" }
  ]
}
```

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Features

- **Visual Spell Slot Dots**: Filled (CircleDot) for available, empty (Circle) for used
- **Resource Badges**: Color-coded with reset timing indicators
- **Inline Controls**: Quick +/- buttons for immediate updates
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes reflect immediately without page refresh

## ðŸ”— Component Integration

- âœ… `PlayerCharacterSheet` - Shows ResourceTracker during combat
- âœ… `CampaignHub` - Provides ResourceSetupDialog for configuration
- âœ… `RestManager` - Automatically restores resources based on rest type
- âœ… `PartyRestManager` - Resets all party resources on long rest
